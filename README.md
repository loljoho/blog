# Blog

My simple, boring Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages

## Overview

This is a simple [Jekyll][jekyll-site] blog deployed on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].

I hope it brings as much elation, entertainment, and education to its readers as much as it did for me while I was developing it!


## Details

This is a simple blog built with the [Jekyll][jekyll-site] static site generator in [Ruby][ruby-site] and deployed on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].

It relies primarily on [Markdown][markdown-wiki] for its posts, and functions without any databse!
