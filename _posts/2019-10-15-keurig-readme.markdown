It has recently come to my attention that a number of individuals are puzzled or intimidated by the contraption in the corner, so I've taken time out of of my *extremely busy life* to write up a README describing its use.

If you see the bottle(s) of water running low, kindly (and carefully) fill them up at the water fountain located outside the room.


## Prerequisites

 - A clean cup or other container that is capable of holding hot liquids
 - Water
 - Hands
 - Brain

## Procedure

### Step 1 - Power

**Press the "ON" button**

 - You should see the button illuminate, reflecting the fact that it is now turned on
 - Ensure the machine is plugged into a grounded outlet or it will not turn on
 - *Do not* attempt to plug the power cord anywhere else

### Step 2 - Water

**Fill *your cup* with the desired amount of water, lift the reservoir lid, and pour the water in; then *place your cup underneath on the drip tray***

 - Make sure your cup is clean or use a clean cup from the counter to do this
 - Make sure the total amount of water in the reservoir does not exceed your cup/container capacity
 - The machine *will* use all of the water which may result in a watery brew and/or burns when it overflows
 - Please *do not* fill the reservoir directly

### Step 4 - K-Cup

**Lift the handle, remove any previously used pods, and place your desired K-Cup pod in the holder; then lower the handle**

 - A sharp needle will puncture the K-Cup pod upon closing--do not remove the foil
 - Do not attempt to touch the needle

### Step 5 - Brew

**Press the "Brew" button**

 - Once it finishes brewing, try to remember to remove your used K-Cup pod from the holder for the next person
 - If it begins to overflow, panic and scream--you clearly did not read these directions thoroughly
 - Enjoy (:
